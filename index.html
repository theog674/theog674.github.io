                     Daily Insight of Global Politics! 
                </h2>

                <p> By Theo Goulden</p>
            
                <p>This week for politics has been a crazy one to say the least. I haven’t even looked at the news, so maybe I’m the least prepared to be writing an article about what went on this week. To begin, we have war in every continent except Antarctica (well that’s if the Penguins aren’t at war- how are we supposed to know). These wars have become part of daily life, and the actors/organisations that have the power to stop these conflicts don’t have the necessary power/legislation, and/or that are making money from the wars, so they don’t really care. It is sad to see. Nothing works, as well as the international relations theory I studied at university which is supposed to gain a greater understanding on why states (countries) act the way they do. On the financial side, the economy is good. That’s what the IMF, Bank of England and the FED say, so I believe them. Even though now reflecting upon this statement, I think otherwise. House prices are skyrocketing, national debt ceilings are above the ozone layer, population savings account are non-existent, and my investments are stagnating. What more is there to say? Oh yeah, income inequality increases and increases. The richest people become richer, and everyone else has enough money for a coffee and spaghetti hoops for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This information is available all over the web, but all the mainstream news outlets utilise “Consumer journalism’. In sum, posting articles that catch the attention of the web user so the news outlets can make money. I condone this. Every outlet is the same, trying to post the most recent story before any other outlet can. This website does the opposite, it aims to educate people about what actually going on, and make it more interesting and un-biased. Anyway, To be honest, you must have an extreme amount of focus to be an journalist, I have only wrote a paragraph, and don’t have the determination to continue writing this article!

                <p class="arash">'Fianncial jargon' Why finance should be a bedrock subject in education globally  </p>
                <p>Drafted by Theo (Again)</p>
                <p>Finance is a boring subject. It is just numbers, calculations and formulas. This is true and the reality. But finance is an extremely important subject. It is true that money isn’t all we live for as humans. But money does make the world spin. Without money in today’s society, good luck. Even though everyone will argue that life should be more focused on travelling, having kids, and living memories, in order to do this, money is essential. I find it interesting how life revolves around currency, yet we have to figure out what money is for ourselves. There is no book given to all students on what is currency, how it works. How are we supposed to figure out what something is and be financially sufficient in the future if we are instead taught statistics and English language? It is true that the banks don’t want you to be educated on finance; it is how they make money. Your poor financial education is what makes them rich. To keep it this way, banks all across the world lobby their respective governments to censor the education of financial literacy to all. If you want to learn, you have to learn yourself. In some respects, I understand this. If people were all taught how to invest effectively, they may make loads of money and not follow their true aspirations. Furthermore, independent research is the best way to learn. By going out there and understanding finance yourself, you can learn from previous mistakes, and how to avoid the same mistakes in the future. But, in essence, financial educational is still essential. Once individuals finish education (that’s if you made it to year 11, and competed 6th form!) you are chucked into the deep end. At University, you are provided a student loan, have to rent a house, and get buy on pocket change. For most, your key (and only) advisors for your finance are your parents. They have utilised currency all their lives, so they should know right? Well it depends how well off your parents are. Having parents with poor financial judgement will likely mean their children will follow in their footsteps. To rid of this issue, it is a simple one. Make financial literacy a bedrock subject in schools and colleges. I don’t insist it to be based on how to construct a discounted cash flow analysis of Ebay, or financial jargon such as PE, PEG ratios and moving averages. What it should be is key modules. For instance: Taxes, what they are, how they work, how to be tax efficient. Or another example: Saving, how to save effectively and build for the future. These are 2 examples, and I could include many more. Just a basic introduction of how the world of currency works. This would aid so many people. It is true the government is to blame. For them, money is needed for them can keep operating, but by not educating the masses effectively on the basics of finance means they can attain more money.  But, back to my point on finance education, it is essential we have qualified financial teaches. I wouldn’t listen to my PE teacher, how is he/she to know?  But we don’t want financial advisors also. They would recommend something that guarantees they make commission. What we need is individuals with a great understanding of finance, worked in the field, and are passionate about teaching individuals what they know! In conclusion, I believe I have provided a subtle argument on why finance should be an essential education subject.</p>

                    Hi my name is Theo! I created this webiste through the couch to coder course with BrightNetwork. I am an International Relations graduate from the University of Exeter. I am in the process of discoivering my career ambtions, and ambitious about attainng occupation in foreign policy, diplomacy, and/or cybersecurity. I chose to create this webiste because, lets be honest, all news/media websites are way too serious and boring. This wesbiste is my attempt to make a politics-based website fun and not so serious. Hope you enjoy the wesbite!
